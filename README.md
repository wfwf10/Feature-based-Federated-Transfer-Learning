We propose the FbFTL as an innovative federated learning approach to reduce the uplink payload by more than five orders of magnitude. Please refer to the paper for explicit explaination on learning structure, system design, and privacy analysis.

# Required packages installation
We use python==3.6.9, torch==1.4.0, torchvision==0.5.0, CUDA version 11.6
